## **Features**
- Create looped walking paths to meet daily step goals.
- Leverages **OpenRouteService API** for optimized paths.
- Step-length calculator based on height and gender.
- Visualize routes on an interactive **Leaflet map**.
- Save routes in a **Dexie database (IndexedDB)** for persistence.
- Download GPX files for offline navigation.
- Customizable routes and user preferences.

## **Technologies Used**
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/):** An ultra-fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime used for developing this application.
- **[Mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise):** An dev-tools manager for nearly everything.
- **OpenRouteService API:** For route generation and optimization.
- **Leaflet.js:** For map visualization and interactivity.
- **Dexie.js:** For storing routes and persistent data in IndexedDB.
- **React & Next.js:** For building the appâ€™s interactive user interface.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/itishermann/10k-steps.git
    cd 10k-steps
    ```
2. Ensure [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is installed.  
   Check with:
    ```bash
    bun -v
    ```
   If not installed, install the version 1.2.0 or higher with mise:
    ```bash
      mise trust
      mise install bun
    ```

3. Install dependencies using Bun:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your app.

---

## **Usage**
1. Input your height and gender to calculate your step length.
2. Set your desired step goal (default: 10,000 steps).
3. Generate a personalized walking route based on your preferences.
4. Preview the route on the map.
5. Save the route to local storage or download the GPX file for offline navigation.
6. Hit the path and start walking toward your fitness goals!

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Step Length Calculation**: The app calculates your individual step length based on height and gender to optimize path planning.
2. **Path Generation**: Uses the **OpenRouteService API** to calculate looped walking paths that match your desired step count.
3. **Visualization**: Routes are displayed on a **Leaflet.js map**, allowing you to easily preview the distance and terrain.
4. **Storage**: Routes are stored in an IndexedDB-powered **Dexie database** for future retrieval.
5. **GPX File Export**: Save routes as GPX files for offline use on compatible fitness trackers and apps.
